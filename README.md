This is a crate with Python bindings for the li-stephens crate which has a model to compute the likelihood of a test sequence being drawn from a population consisting of some given reference set of sequences. It allows calling the Rust code from Python which provides a large speedup compared to a native Python implementation as well as allows direct interfacing with the much more diverse and well developed Python ecosystem.
