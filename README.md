This is a crate with Python bindings for the li-stephens crate which has a model to compute the likelihood of a test sequence being drawn from a population consisting of some given reference set of sequences. It allows calling the Rust code from Python which provides a large speedup compared to a native Python implementation as well as allows direct interfacing with the much more diverse and well developed Python ecosystem.

Linux Wheel files for installing the build Python package can be found in the target directory.
